Learn how to create a real-time face mask detector using Tensorflow, Keras, and OpenCV with your webcam or mobile camera

## Introduction
This is a deep learning project. I used Convolutional Neural Networks to classify MNIST handwritten data. For more convenient propose of test data, used Tkinter to deploy a desktop app that can run any Os. You just need to select an image then all work done by this app. With this app anyone can apply image classification

## Why CNN
In this project Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) used as Image classsifier. We have two types of data face with mask and face with no mask.These two types of data are classifiy by the CNN model.

## Why App.py
We implement an open-cv based face detection model. By using OpenCV haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file we extract face ROI from an image. Then the face ROI image fits it to the CNN model. Furthermore, like a binary classifier, the CNN model classifies whether the face ROI image is face with a mask or not. 


## How to use my code

With my code, you can:
* **Open cnn.ipynb => Train CNN model from scratch and save weight as h5 file**
* **Run App.py**

## Dependencies:

* **python 3**
* **Tensorflow**
* **Keras**
* **opencv (cv2)**
* **Numpy**
* **Pillow**

## Datasets:

I used 4 different datases: VOC2007, VOC2012, COCO2014 and COCO2017. Statistics of datasets I used for experiments is shown below

| Dataset                | Classes | #Train images/objects | #Validation images/objects |
|------------------------|:---------:|:-----------------------:|:----------------------------:|
| Own                    |    2      |      1200+              |           1200+             |
